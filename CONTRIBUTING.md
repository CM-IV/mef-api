# Contribution Guidelines for The Monero Economic Forum API

## Read over the docs

Before making any PRs, make sure to read over what is already in the docs and check the code out.  If something needs to be added and fleshed out in a previous section, let me know.

## Make the PRs to the Master branch of the remote repository

You've probably noticed the many feature branches of the repository, leave those be and make your changes on your own local fork/branch and make your PR to the remote Master branch for me to review.


## Follow the rules set forth by Hacktoberfest to the best of your ability.

Be cool and professional, hone your skills and help others out at the same time.  If I've messed something up, then let me know - this is a first for me maintaining a Hacktoberfest repo.
